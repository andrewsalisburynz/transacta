- **Documentation**: aidlc-docs/ only
- **Structure patterns**: See code-generation.md Critical Rules

## Execution Plan Summary
- **Total Phases to Execute**: 11 phases
- **Phases to Skip**: 0 phases
- **Estimated Duration**: 32-46 hours
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM

### Phases to Execute
**INCEPTION (4 phases)**:
1. Workflow Planning (current)
2. Application Design - New components and services needed
3. Units Planning - Complex data models, APIs, and ML algorithms
4. Units Generation - Generate concrete specifications

**CONSTRUCTION (7 phases)**:
5. Functional Design - Complex business logic and component methods
6. NFR Requirements - Performance, security, scalability requirements
7. NFR Design - Implementation strategies for NFRs
8. Infrastructure Design - Local web server, database, ML model storage
9. Code Planning - Implementation approach and structure
10. Code Generation - Complete application implementation
11. Build and Test - Verification and quality assurance

### Phases to Skip
None - All conditional phases will execute due to greenfield project complexity
